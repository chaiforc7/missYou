# missYou
**missYou** is a lasting communal space that engages and brings communities together after death.

## Why I started this project
I'm excited to be working on this project when I was 11, I lost my mum, it was back in 2006, Dad traveled with other of my siblings. I slept in mum's room with her by my side. 

It was 11:30 pm, I heard my other siblings crying, I woke up, and mum was gone.  It's 14 years since mum left us and every  30th April, we remember her in the Holy Mass for her beautiful soul to rest in peace. 

To keep her memorial and cause those of us who have lost our loved ones, I have decided to build **missYou**, a platform to help people honor their loved ones who are no more.

**missYou**  allows anyone to create a memorial page for their lost one, invite other people to learn more about them, and also share stories and pictures the had with this lost one.
